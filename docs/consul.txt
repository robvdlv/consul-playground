What is Consul
	Consul is service discovery
	Service discovery, is a way to discover communication paths between services
	
	Multi datacenter
	
How does it work
	binary runs in agentmode/server mode
	works over network; gossip protocol
		server is up/ but service is down
		works best 3..5 agents in server mode
			less, risk not quorom -> what does this mean
	
	
Consul

	is service discovery, config, and orch made easy
	distributed, datacenter aware
	
	service discovery
	what questions answered
	- where is service foo
	- two ways: http/dns; dns is legacy and easily understood
	- integrate with it easily
	
	* service discovery supports service discovery internal and external services
	
	* failure detection

		answers question: is service healthy?
		discovery is failure detection, because you dont want to discover a server which is not running
		
		dns wont return healthy services
		http will tell you details
	
	* key value storage

	answers: what is the config of service x
		tied closely to discovery aspect of it; kv is replicated and available
		
		can watch the configuration; pushed down to logic
		
		can set ACL across these things
		the user service should never be able to get the non user passwords
		
		kv also multi datacenter
	
	* multi datacenter
	
		living in a world where multidatacenter bar is way down
		
		can view all of it in one ui
	
	* orchestration features
	
		able to control services that are already controlled
		
		events, execs, watches
		
		events:
		send an event out to your cluster
		scalable, highly probablistic (percentage calculatable)
		
		watches:
		watch an event, execute a cmd, such as deploy
		
		orchestration tools:
		three different models;
		tradeoff for right tool for job
		all approaches are used by users with a lot of agents; they work well
		
	* operation bullet points
	
		uses raft consensus protocol (read up)
		gossip protocol for aliveness
		three consistency models: default, consistent, stale
		encryption, ACLs availble
		real world usage to 1000s of agents per datacenter
		
	consul and docker
	
		two approaches
		can run consul agent IN or OUT container
		both well supported, theres tradeoffs
		
		big question is:
		to docker or not to docker
		tradeoffs is that:
		
			- consul in docker: health checks must be network based due to isolation
			- consul on host (that is running docker): can run health checks that enter container, invoke docker for rich checks (file tests, pid tests etc): break in jail
			- up to you, both ways work with above caveats
